      <p class="text-gray-300">Hi, my name is Illya Moskalenko and I'm a 3rd year computer science and gamedev student at Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology.
        Welcome to my portfolio! This page showcases the game projects Iâ€™ve worked on, as well as those I'm currently developing.
        I am passionate about programming, especially gamedev, and that is why I love exploring different aspects of it, whether it's gameplay mechanics, visuals, or systems programming.
        So far, all my projects have been built in Unity, but I'm interested in exploring Unreal Engine as well.</p>

        <!-- Game 1 -->
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">3D Diploma game in Unity</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">For my diploma project, I am currently working in a team of 4 on a low-poly 3D game in Unity.
            We use Agile methodology, planning our tasks in one-week sprints in Jira and presenting our weekly progress during classes.
            The game combines sci-fi puzzle gameplay with elements of atmospheric horror.</p>

        <!-- Game 2 -->
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Law of Attraction</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">Law of Attraction is a 2D platformer game created as part of a GameJam event at PJATK University.
            The theme was "Up Up and Away." Our team of 4 worked under a 20-hour time constraint and took 3rd place.
            In the game, players must go up using a gun that shoots two types of projectiles, which carry different gravitational forces: attraction and repulsion.
            Players navigate by dodging turrets that fire at them while using these gravitational forces to climb in ways that would otherwise be impossible.</p>

        <!-- Game 3 -->
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">3D Tower Defense in Unity</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">This is the second project Iâ€™m currently working on, with the same team of four as in my diploma project.
            The game is a simple tower defense game, and the focus of the project is to learn and apply common design and architectural patterns.</p>

        <!-- Game 4 -->
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Treasure Hunters</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">This was my first project in Unity, with the main goal of learning the engine and gaining experience working on a team project.
            The team consisted of 4 people, and we worked on the project for 6 weeks.
            We used free assets from
            <a href="https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/treasure-hunters" target="_blank" class="text-blue-400 underline"> PixelFrog's Treasure Hunters pack </a>
            and implemented all game logic according to a Game Design Document (GDD) template.</p>
